## How to Use
**First**, click here > [Use this template](https://github.com/simmxns/apk-template/generate)
### Visual Studio Code way
1. Install [Android by adelphes](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=adelphes.android-dev-ext)
2. Install Java Support [Language Support for Java(TM) by Red Hat](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=redhat.java)

*then* <br>
Open the terminal and put this inside
```bash
.\gradlew build
.\gradlew assembleDebug
```
And finally compile(Ctrl + F5) or debug(F5) your app

### (Neo)Vim way
Put this in your init.vim
```vim
Plug "hsanson/vim-android"
```
With [COC](https://github.com/neoclide/coc.nvim) install Java. (I personally recommend this way because with LSP you need to do things that coc do more easier) <br>
`:CocInstall coc-java`

### CMD way
In your terminal build the project then just install the apk and open it.
```bash
.\gradlew build
.\gradlew installDebug
```

‚ö†Ô∏è<b>(WARNING)</b> <i>I think it's a bit obvious but, before all this, you need to link your devices with ADB</i> `adb devices` <i>and yeah, that's it</i>‚ö†Ô∏è
